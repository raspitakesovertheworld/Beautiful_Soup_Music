### Beautiful Soup Music

A web scraper example in python, by Markus Bawidamann (January 2021)

This is using the beautiful soup library in Python to download public domain mp3s from a remix website. 
It grabs all the links from individual pages of the website and then iterates through them, downloading the files.


The URL is just as an example, I have changed it to not cause too much traffic to the website.
